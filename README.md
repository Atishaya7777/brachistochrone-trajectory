# Brachistochrone Trajectory Using Monte Carlo Integration

This was a project I did over Summer 2023 to approximate Brachistochrone Trajectory using monte carlo integration techniques without the use of the calculus of variations.

Our hope was to figure out a way to show that the brachistochrone trajectory was optimal without deriving or using calculus explicitly.
